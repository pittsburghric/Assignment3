Assignment3
===========

This is the base project for Assignment 3

Due: Beginning of Class, Feb 14

Interface Builder play...
==========================

You’re going to read the provided source and provide a User Interface as well as some light code to make it work. 

1. We want a table view that initially shows 50 bananas, 
2. Shows the wikipedia entry for banana when we select one of the bananas in the table 
3. Has a button to add all the checkmarks and remove them 
4. A button to clear all the fruit out of the cart
5. A button to repopulate all the fruit in the cart.

Bonus: 
Can you enable/disable the buttons based on the state? For example: disable the “Add Fruit” button when there is already fruit, and enable it only when there is none. Also the inverse for “Remove Fruit”.

Follow along with our slides thus far, in particular, Feb 5th’s slides.

1. Go to https://github.com/evansdavid
2. Fork the repo “Assignment 3” and clone it to your machine - this is the app that we created in class on 2/5*
3. Click on Assignment3.xcodeproj to open Xcode. (If Xcode isn’t installed on your machine, just ask one of the friendly folk at the desk or use this link: https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
4. Open up the XIB files and use what you see in the .h files for the ViewControllers to make a User Interface.
5. There are some IBActions and IBOutlets we didn’t cover in class, so watch out for those.
6. Use git to add/commit/push your changes back to your github repo.
